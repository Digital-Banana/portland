FOSS4G, JS.Geo, WhereCampPDX...we're still riding the high of Portland's big geo conferences. So, starting October 2, we resume our regularly scheduled Maptimes with another meetup at the Esri R&D center in downtown Portland. This month:

* __[Imposter Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)__ - tough time acknowledging your own accomplishments? Getting burned out by feeling your work is never good enough? We'll shed some light on this bad mojo that affects a lot people in the tech community.
* __[Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/#darwin)__ - Mapbox Studio, the design studio for creating custom maps from OSM sources as well as your own has officially launched. We'll demo the features of this powerful tool and chat about the similarities and differences between it and TileMill, its predecessor.

If you have an idea or presentation you'd like to give, please tweet at us @maptimepdx and we'll put you on the agenda. Hope to see in October!
