MaptimePDX picks up again this month at the [Esri offices](http://calagator.org/venues/202394387) in downtown Portland. Here's what we'll be chatting about:

* __[Transportation Hackathon](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/avenues-to-advocacy-hackathon-tickets-13904646171)__ - This weekend, the Community Cycling Center with Code for Portland is building a tool to make transportation advocacy accessible to people from all backgrounds - dewonkifying the wonkery of city budgets, citizen reporting, and community meetings. The hackathon will involve updating and implementing the key features of the Avenues to Advocacy civic engagement tool - anyone that's interested in transportation planning, biking, walking, map technology, government data, or increasing access to transportation advocacy is welcome to join. (No tech experience necessary, there's roles for everyone.) Snacks, coffee, and lunch provided with ticket. Tickets are free, just RSVP using the eventbrite link.

* __[Maptime Website](http://www.maptime.io/)__ - the official Maptime website has re-launched under a new look and management strategy. We'll point out some key features and how to contribute.

* __[QGIS](http://qgis.org)__ - QGIS 2.6 is out. Let's see what's new.

If you have an idea or presentation you'd like to give, please tweet at us [@maptimepdx](http://twitter.com/maptimepdx) and we'll put you on the agenda. See you Thursday!
