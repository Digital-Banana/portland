Come learn about the basics of Open Street Map (OSM) and how to contribute as a remote mapper for local and Humanitarian OSM Team (HOT) mapping projects. 

Please bring your own laptop. We will provide all the learning materials needed so feel free to come even if you've never mapped before! This is a beginner friendly event with experienced mappers who can help.

###Schedule
