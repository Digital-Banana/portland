### Hand-drawn maps!

Leave the laptops at home because [@MaptimePDX](https://twitter.com/maptimepdx) is going analog - AKA it's arts & crafts time!

We will be providing paper, maps, crayons and way to create map tiles from our drawings.

Feel free to bring the kids!

Pizza and drinks will be provided!
