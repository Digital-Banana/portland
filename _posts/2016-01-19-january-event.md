Grant Humphries of Trimet will start your 2016 right with an OpenStreetMap 101 session! Come learn the basics of the "Wikipedia of maps" and get started mapping the places you love.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, editable map of the whole world that is being built by volunteers largely from scratch and released with an open-content license.

Please bring a computer as this will be a beginner friendly and hands-on Maptime.

Pizza and drinks will be provided by Esri and the space has been provided by WeWork.

Agenda:

• 6:00-6:15: Social time

• 6:15-6:30: Intro/grab pizza

• 6:30-7:30:  OSM Tutorial
