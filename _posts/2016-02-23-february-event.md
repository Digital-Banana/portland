MaptimePDX is excited to welcome [John Gravois](https://twitter.com/geogangster) from [Esri](https://developers.arcgis.com/) for November's meetup!

Come and check out some of Esri's free resources for publishing data, performing spatial analysis and creating websites to share your work.

We'll focus on:

- Introducing [Esri Leaflet](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/)

- Fundamentals of JavaScript (variables, methods, events etc.)

- Q/A

This is a hands-on and beginner friendly event! Bring your laptop and questions.

Come hungry! Pizza provided by Esri.

Thank you to WeWork for providing the space!
