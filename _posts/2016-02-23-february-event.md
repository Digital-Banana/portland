Join us February 23rd from 6:00 to 8:00 PM at WeWork in the Custom House at 220 NW 8th Ave, Portland, OR.

We will be joining forces with the Tableau User Meetup group this month to talk about mapping in Tableau!

Tableau is business intelligence software that allows anyone to easily connect to data, then visualize and create interactive, sharable dashboards. It's easy enough that any Excel user can learn it, but powerful enough to satisfy even the most complex analytical problems. Securely sharing your findings with others only takes seconds.
